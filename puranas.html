            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Purana is a Sanskrit word that contains a mythological account of early times. In non-Vedic Sanskrit studies, Purana is considered the smriti category of scripture, which means it is holy writing containing traditional knowledge on religion, domestic and social practice. Puranas are created by humans and passed from one generation to another generation. Smriti means memory in Sanskrit. The Purana includes a broad classification of ritual lore and myth of Indian literature. The initial versions of several Puranas were composed in the middle of the 3rd and 10th centuries. There are 18 major Puranas and 18 minor Puranas, with more than 400,000 poems. The Purana deals with cosmogony, the creation of God and human beings, and the origin and creation of the universe. Purana consists of guidelines for ritual practice to invoke God. It has several mythological stories related to different gods.
