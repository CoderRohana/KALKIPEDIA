            <h3>KALKI PURANA</h3>
            <p>The Kalki Purana (Sanskrit: कल्किपुराण, romanized: Kalkipurāṇa) is a Vaishnava Hindu text about the tenth avatar of Vishnu named Kalki. 
                The beginning of the Kalki Purana describes Kali's lineage starting with Brahma, his great-great-grandfather, and ending with the birth of his children's children. Instead of being born of poison from the churning of the ocean of milk according to other Hindu texts, he is the product of a long line of incestuous monsters born from Brahma's back. Kali is the great-great-grandson of Brahma. He is the son of Krodha (Anger) and his sister-turned-wife Himsa (Violence). He is the grandson of Dambha (Vanity) and his sister Maya (Illusion). He is the great-grandson of Adharma (Impropriety) and his wife, Mithya (Falsehood). Adharma was originally created from Brahma's back as a malinapataka (a very dark and deadly sinful object). Kali and his family were created by Brahma to hasten the dissolution of the cosmos after the pralaya period was over. When his family takes human form on earth, they further taint the hearts and minds of mankind to bring about the end of the Dvapara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali Yuga. During the first stage of the Kali Yuga, the varnashrama breaks down and deific worship is forsaken by man. All through the second, third, and fourth stages, man forgets the name of god and no longer offers yajna (offerings) to the devas.
                Brahma and the devas approach Vishnu for protection from the evils of the Kali Yuga. After listening to accounts of violence and injustice occurring in the universe, Vishnu promises to be born into the family of Vishnuyashas and Sumati, in a village called Shambala,on the thirteenth day during the fortnight of the waxing moon. Many people will have to sacrifice their lives fighting for the birth of Kalki. At a young age, he is taught the holy scriptures on topics such as dharma, karma, artha, jñāna, and undertakes military training under the care of the Parashurama (the sixth incarnation of Vishnu). Soon, Kalki worships Shiva, who gets pleased by the devotion and provides him in return a divine white horse named Devadatta (a manifestation of Garuda), a powerful sword, whereby its handle is bedecked with jewels, and a parrot named Shuka, who is an all-knower; the past, the present and the future.Other accessories are also given by other devas, devis, saints, and righteous kings. Kalki then marries princess Padmavati (an incarnation of Lakshmi), the daughter of King Vrihadratha and Queen Kaumudi of Simhala (the island of the lion) and princess Ramā, the daughter of King Shashidhvaja and Queen Sushanta.He fights in many wars, ends evil, including Kali and his entire family bloodline, which is wiped out by the avatar's generals; he perishes from wounds inflicted by Dharma and Satya Yuga personified. Kalki, meanwhile, battles and simultaneously kills the asura's most powerful generals, Koka and Vikoka, twin asuras adept in the dark arts. Kalki then returns to Shambala to rule, inaugurates a new yuga for the good and divides the earth among his generals. Sumati and Vishnuyasha, his parents, will then travel to the holy place of Badrikashrama, where they will live. Kalki then leaves the earth to go to Vaikuntha as his dharma (duty) is completed.

        <p>According to the Kalki Purana, the Kali Yuga will be full of conflict, misery, sin, corruption and evil.
            Adharma will be everywhere and people will stop being religious. Kali Yuga is the worst Yuga of all the Yugas.  
            Now Kali Pirush will get his powers from sins that humans will commit. He is the destroyer of society.
            Some of the attributes of Kali Yuga are:
            Deception and Dishonesty in society,
            conflict and lust in society,
            loss of spirituality,
            corruption and injustice.
            Kali Yuga began after the end of the Mahabharata war, marking the transition from the Dvapara Yuga to the present age. Kali Yuga is described as an era of darkness and ignorance, where truth and virtue are overshadowed by falsehood and immorality.
            It is believed that Vishnu will take his Kalki Avatar to come and destroy Kali and Kali Yuga, marking the transition again back to Satya Yuga.
